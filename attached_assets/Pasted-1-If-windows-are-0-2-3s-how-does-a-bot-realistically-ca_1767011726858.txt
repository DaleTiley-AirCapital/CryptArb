1️⃣ “If windows are 0.2–3s, how does a bot realistically catch them?”
Short version:

You don’t spam REST every 0.1s.

You do use a smarter setup: WebSockets + moderate polling + sensible thresholds.

And on Luno/SA exchanges, mispricings usually last longer than 0.2s anyway.

a) You don’t need 0.1s REST spam
If you tried to hit:

Luno REST every 0.1s

Binance REST every 0.1s

…you’d:

Smash into rate limits

Waste bandwidth / CPU

Risk being blocked

Instead, you do something like:

Binance → use WebSocket order book stream

You get price updates pushed to you in real-time.

No polling, no spam — just a live feed.

Luno → REST polling every 300–800 ms

Luno has lower liquidity, so mispricings actually tend to stick around slightly longer (often > 1s).

You are not competing with HFT firms colocated in data centers; SA retail books move slower.

So your effective “reaction time” is something like:

New price event from Binance stream

Within 0.3–0.8s you fetch Luno’s book

You compute executable spread

If net > threshold → fire orders

That’s perfectly realistic on Railway, a VPS, or similar.

b) Will Railway “crash” from this?
No. What matters is:

How expensive your loop is (CPU, memory) → if you keep things light, you’re fine.

How often you hit external APIs → bounded by rate limits (you’ll design around those limits).

A simple Python/FastAPI app on Railway:

Can easily handle a background loop doing:

2–4 REST calls/second

One WebSocket client

As long as you:

Don’t do heavy blocking I/O

Don’t spawn tons of threads

If we want to be extra safe, we can:

Poll Luno at 500 ms

Use WebSockets for Binance

Only execute when spread is big enough that even 500–800 ms of drift still leaves profit.

That’s how small arbitrage desks do it without spending a fortune on infra.

2️⃣ “If mismatches are rare, how did you calculate R16k/month on 100k?”
You’re totally right to question this. Let’s unpack the assumptions and be brutally honest.

Earlier, I did scenario modelling, not a guarantee:

I assumed:

Certain net spread per trade (e.g. 0.8–1%)

A number of successful trades per month (e.g. 12–18 in the “aggressive” case)

Monthly profit ≈
capital × net_spread × number_of_trades

For example:

Capital: R100,000

Net spread per successful trade: 0.8% → R800

20 good trades in a month: 20 × 800 = R16,000

Is that possible? Yes.
Is it guaranteed with one pair and one exchange combo? No.
It depends on:

How often real, executable spreads appear (after fees + bid/ask + slippage)

How many exchanges/pairs you include

Market volatility in that period

So let’s reframe more conservatively and realistically.

🔍 More honest ranges
Say we’re running only Luno ↔ Binance BTC to start.

Let’s assume:

Average executable net spread: 0.4–0.7% per trade after all costs

Genuinely clean opportunities:

Conservative: 2–4 per month

Moderate: 5–10 per month

Aggressive (with multiple pairs/exchanges): 15–25 per month

Then:

Conservative (BTC only, Luno/Binance):
0.5% net × 4 trades × R100k = R2,000/month

Moderate (BTC + maybe ETH later, still Luno/Binance):
0.6% net × 8 trades × R100k = R4,800/month

Aggressive (several pairs + more exchanges + higher volatility months):
0.8% net × 20 trades × R100k = R16,000/month

So that R16k/month lives in the upper bound / aggressive / multi‑engine scenario, not “this will just happen automatically on day 1”.

If we’re being sober:

Start planning around R2k–R5k/month on R100k in early stages.

Treat anything above that as upside that you only believe once live data proves it.

3️⃣ So what’s the real path to those higher numbers?
To get closer to that R16k/month type of performance in practice, you’d likely need:

More than one pair

BTC/ZAR, ETH/ZAR

Possibly USDT/ZAR

More than one local exchange

Luno, VALR, Ovex (ZAR spreads can be juicy between locals)

A global engine too

Binance ↔ Bybit ↔ Kraken, etc., in USDT

Volatile market conditions

Big moves = more desync = more spreads

And a bot that:

Uses WebSockets where possible

Polls REST sensibly

Calculates executable spreads (bid/ask, depth, slippage, fees)

Trades both directions

Adjusts position size based on depth

Doesn’t overtrade when the edge isn’t there

4️⃣ Where this leaves us, realistically
You’ve correctly spotted that:

Naïve “price vs price” arbitrage is mostly fake.

The real edge lives in:

Order book microstructure

Fast but sane infra

Rare but real moments of mispricing

Profits are scenario-based, not guaranteed.

So a more grounded plan:

Phase 1 – Build the bot; run in paper mode or tiny size for 1–3 months.

Collect stats:

How many actual opportunities per day/week?

Average net spread per executed trade?

Slippage profile by size & time of day?

Only then decide:

“Is this more like a R2k/month engine or a R15k/month engine on 100k?”

Until then, all numbers are planned scenarios, not promises.

If you’d like, next I can:

Write the actual arbitrage decision algorithm in pseudocode or Python, including:

Using bid/ask

Computing depth‑aware prices

Applying a net spread threshold

Or design the metrics logger so that from day 1 your bot records:

Every potential spread

Every executed trade

So we can empirically answer:
“How rare are these moments really on Luno/Binance?”
